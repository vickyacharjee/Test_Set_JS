a library or a module and publishing it to npm, consider using tags for releases.
 Common tags include major, minor, and patch. 

 version-> 4.18.2
 so,  
## 4 is major (uses as strict Increment the MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes.)  
 
## 18 is minor (Recommended bug fixes, as secutity piont of view Increment the MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner.)  

## 2 patch (very basic Increment the PATCH version when you make backward-compatible bug fixes.)




In npm package versioning, the caret (^) symbol is used in the dependencies or devDependencies section of the package.json file. It indicates a range of compatible versions for a package.

Here's how it works:

^major.minor.patch: This allows updates that do not modify the leftmost non-zero digit. It means the package can be updated to any version that includes the specified major and minor versions but allows for patches to be updated.
For example, if you have "express": "^4.17.1" in your package.json:

It allows installing any version of Express that is 4.x.x (where x can be any number).
If the latest version is 4.17.5, running npm install would install version 4.17.5.
If a new patch version is released, say 4.17.6, running npm install would install version 4.17.6.
The caret is particularly useful when you want to ensure compatibility with the latest patches but avoid breaking changes. It's part of semantic versioning (SemVer), where the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH versions convey specific meanings, and the caret helps you express your willingness to accept compatible updates.
